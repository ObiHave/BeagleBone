# BeagleBone

This was the software used to operate an IoT-Fan designed by Team 19 in Wright State University's 2019 cycle of Team Projects.

The components include:
* Stepper motor driver to operate a stepper motor to control oscillation and positioning.
* DC Motor driver to operate the speed of the fan blade motor to change the fan speed via PWM.
* UDP Sockets to communicate over WiFi to a mobile device connected to the BBBW WiFi network.
